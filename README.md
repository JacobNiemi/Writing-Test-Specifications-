Unit Tests for the 'multiplication' Function:

   1. Expect multiplication(2, 3) to be a number
   2. Expect multiplication(2, 3) to be equal to 6
   3. Expect multiplication(0, 10) to be equal to 0
   4. Expect multiplication(5, -4) to be equal to -20
   5. Expect multiplication("a", 16) to be an error (non-numeric input)

Unit Tests for the 'concatOdds' Function:

   1. Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to be an array
   2. Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to contain -1
   3. Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to contain 1
   4. Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to contain 3
   5. Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to contain 9
   6. Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to contain 15
   7. Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) not to contain 4
   8. Expect concatOdds([2, 4, 6], [8, 10, 12]) to return an empty array (no odd numbers)
   9. Expect concatOdds([1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]) to contain only one 1, since it's repeated in both arrays.

Functional Tests for the Shopping Cart Checkout:

   1. When a user with items in their cart chooses to check out as a guest, they should be prompted to enter their shipping information.
   2. When a user with items in their cart chooses to log in during checkout, they should be directed to the login page first and then redirected back to the checkout process after successful authentication.
   3. When a user with an empty cart tries to check out, they should be notified that their cart is empty and prompted to continue shopping.
   4. During the checkout process, the user should see a summary of their order, including items, quantities, and prices.
   5. After completing the checkout process as a guest, the user should be given the option to create an account for faster checkout in the future.
   6. If the user chooses to log in during checkout and has items in their cart, the items should persist after successful login.
   7. If the user chooses to create an account during checkout, they should be prompted to enter necessary account information such as email and password.
   8. After completing the checkout process, regardless of the chosen method (guest, login, or create account), the user should receive a confirmation email with order details.
   9. If the user encounters any errors during the checkout process, such as invalid shipping information or payment failure, they should be notified accordingly with clear instructions on how to proceed.
